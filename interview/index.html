			<h2> Interviewer: Why did you decide to enrol in graphic design program at Niagara College? What choices brought you here?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="a">

			<p>There are three reasons why I chose Niagara College. Niagara College is located in 
			Welland which is peaceful and harmless. I find that live and study here are quite safe and quiet, so I can focus on my goals. Moreover, I have read a lot of information to choose the college. Niagara College is famous for the satisfaction of domestic and international students. I did the research that graphic design’s facilities at Niagara College are high quality. Honesty, I was too timid when I first time came to Canada, but when I began to study here, I felt more open-minded and confident. I tried to find something new for myself to do every day because I get bored easily, so I find graphic design program is one of the first choice for me. I love drawing, creating, designing and also communicating; therefore, Niagara College is a great school for me to improve those skills.</p>

			<h2> Interviewer: What career do you wish to pursue? Why have you decided to pursue this career path in particular?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="a">
			<p>I will become a designer, I wish. My Mom said that I need to find a job that I love to do because I will take time with it about 8 hours a day. Based on my personality, I would love to do design every day. With me, design means make everything usual become unusual, and also design will bring for me lots of money and happiness. I can become my own boss, create new process by my own, and make myself have fun with variety of colors. Graphic design requires responsibility, so it will help me to improve my characters. Besides that, my purpose is come back to Viet Nam to work, and graphic design is one of the most popular job nowadays. I will have more opportunities in the future. When I study graphic design, I can learn more about marketing, web publishing, and communicating. Graphic design always develops day by day. It forces me to learn non-stop, and this is a good thing to me.</p>

			<h2>Interviewer: What skills, straits, and value do you possess that might make you a strong candidate in field?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="a">
			<p>I think open-minded is my strong point. I get so excited when I am trying new thing and willing to listen to other’s people advice and ideas. In my opinion, a graphic designer will work with a lot of people, companies and offices, so to know how to listen and share the opinions are necessary. Furthermore, curiosity is very important strait of me. I find that when I begin curious about something new, I will try to learn and challenge myself. Indeed, this will help me to get more experience which lead me to a better version of myself day by day. Thank to getting excited when I begin something new, I will gain more knowledge faster and remember last longer. Those characters lead to another strait which is positive. The reason is when I focus to do something that I love, I will try to overcome every negative thing.</p>

		<div class="q">
			<h2>Interviewer: What challenges – personal and professional- will you need to overcome to ensure your success?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="a">
			<p>The most challenging to me currently is patience and problem solving. I get excited easily and get bored easily. This is the reason why I did not choose any program which are related to numbers, history or chemical. It is very hard to me to keep standard one thing at a long time. I can get disturbed easier than other people. I would try to change my character for a long time, but it seems like nothing has changed. Moreover, problem solving is my weakness. For example, I tend to ignore them instead of finding solutions to solve them. Consequently, I even have more trouble after, and those problems are increasingly until I try to solve them. I know this brings lots of disadvantages; especially with graphic design, I need to solve trouble right away. I hope when I finish three years in college, my bad habit can be fixed.</p>
